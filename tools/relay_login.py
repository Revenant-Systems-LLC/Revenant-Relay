"""One-time manual login for browser-driven adapters.

Opens a real, visible browser using Relay's persistent profile for a platform.
You log in by hand, close the window, and the session cookies stay on disk.
Every run after that is already authenticated.

This exists so no adapter ever types a password. A human does the login once,
including any captcha or 2FA, and the bot inherits the result.

    py -3.11 tools\relay_login.py reddit          # log in
    py -3.11 tools\relay_login.py reddit --check  # is the session still good?
    py -3.11 tools\relay_login.py reddit --reset  # wipe and start over

Close the browser window when you are done. The script waits for it.
